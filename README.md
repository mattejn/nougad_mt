# nougad -- Non-linear unmixing by gradient descent multithreaded (cpu) version

**DANGER:** this is in development right now.

This is as a fork of Nougad by Mirek Kratochvil (https://github.com/exaexa/nougad).
It has been modified to add multithreading.

This package has multiple versions with other fast
implementations available. 
The multithreaded CPU version implemented in C can  be installed via:

```r
devtools::install_github("mattejn/nougad_mt")
```
